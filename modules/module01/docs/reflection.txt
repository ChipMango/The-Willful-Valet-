## My Simulation Identity: [Nova_Byte / Lightning_Lola / etc.]

### Summary
- Best-performing lot: CAM (highest average tip)
- Hardest to debug: FIFO cooldown timing
- Favorite design moment: When LIFO popped exactly as expected under stall
- Goal for Module 2: Use FIFO as base lot, CAM as interrupt-driven VIP handler
