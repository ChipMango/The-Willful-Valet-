## Section 4.1 – Rogue Protocols

- Which interference types does your system currently handle well?
- Which types do you fear will break your FSM?
- What logging or detection strategies could you use to catch these intrusions?
- Would you rather defend every time, or adapt in real-time?

## Section 4.2 – The Entropy Engine

- What type of chaos events did you enable?
- What was your simulation seed and chaos level?
- Did your system catch Mercer in action?
- Which interference types broke your FSM or queues?

## Section 4.3 – Interruption Handlers

- What new FSM states did you add to handle Mercer?
- How does your FSM detect when something has gone wrong?
- What happens if Mercer deletes a tag mid-retrieval?
- Did your system stall? How did it recover?

## Section 4.4 – Theft Trace

- What interference events did you detect and log?
- How did your FSM react to them?
- Can you prove a tag was stolen or injected?
- Did your intrusion logs match Mercer’s actual behavior?

## Section 4.5 – Resilience Score

- What metrics did you use to measure system recovery?
- Did your system log and handle Mercer events effectively?
- What was your final Resilience Score?
- Would you rather increase performance or resilience in the next iteration?

## Section 4.6 – Firewall Modes

- What intrusion triggers activate firewall mode?
- How does your system behave when the firewall is active?
- Can it continue operating, or does it enter a safe pause?
- What logs or waveforms show firewall activation and recovery?

## Section 4.7 – Mercer’s Playground

- How many chaos scenarios did you simulate?
- Which one caused the most disruption?
- What did your system do in response?
- Did you fix any bugs or add new protections as a result?

## Savepoint IV – Chaos Certification Report

- What was your final simulation seed and chaos level?
- What types of interference occurred during simulation?
- How did your FSM and queues respond?
- What was your resilience score?
- What’s one improvement you would still make?

## Section 4.9 – Mercer’s Mood Engine

- What mood states did you define?
- What behaviors did each mood trigger?
- How did mood transitions affect simulation difficulty?
- Was your system able to detect and adapt to Mercer’s changing personality?

## Section 4.10 – Adaptive FSM

- What patterns did your FSM learn to detect?
- What adaptations were triggered based on those patterns?
- Did system performance improve as a result?
- What limitations did you encounter in RTL-based learning?

## Section 4.11 – The Diplomatic Protocol

- What messages did your FSM send? How did Mercer reply?
- Did any treaties hold? What was the result?
- Did you simulate deception or betrayal?
- What did your FSM learn from diplomacy attempts?
- Reflect: Can systems be made to negotiate?

## Section 4.12 – The Mercer Oracle

- What ML technique did you use?
- How did you structure your simulation logs?
- What were your top predictive features?
- How did your system behavior improve after prediction integration?
- Reflect: Should verification adapt AI-based foresight in real systems?
